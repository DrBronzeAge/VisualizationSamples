These are some samples of data analysis and visualization. The four 'PublicationTrends' folders consist of an html file with analysis and visualizations, plus the R code to generate the visualizations (though not the python code to generate the original datasets).  The IntertextHivePlots folder contains only some sample visualizations and the R code to generate them. The nlp pipeline I built to generate the datasets is probably more interesting, but it is not ready for public release. The file contains no analysis, because it was a consulting project limited to doing the nlp/visualizations.
