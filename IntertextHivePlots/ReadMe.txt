These are all the same plot, but in different colour palettes. I sent them all along to my client, since they could not decide which they liked best.  Most elements of it were tuned to the client's preference.

What is happening here isn't obvious, and may be a little more innovative than it appears on the surface. My client came to me with the idea that one of Cicero's (Roman Orator, d. 43 BC.) speeches, the De Domo Sua (De Domo) was largely made up of references to another series of speeches, the orations against Catiline (In Catilinam 1-4), and asked for help in proving/quantifying/visualizing that. I built a small NLP pipeline to identify intextualities (references/points of similarity) between documents and organize them into a graph data structure. 

I have not seen anyone else visualizing intertextuality like this, so I chose a hive plot model because it allowed me to show both the density and distribution of the intertextualities. As you can see, those two documents share a very dense web of connections, which gets more dense for several points in the speeches against Catiline, of which Cicero was apparently very proud.  The third speech, De Haruspicum Responsis, is included essentially as a 'control', to show that the density of connections was greater than normal. I also conducted more traditional tests of significance and passed them on, but I find that they are often not particulalry useful for things like this. Most of them are predicated on comparing your results to random distribution, and language simply isn't random.
